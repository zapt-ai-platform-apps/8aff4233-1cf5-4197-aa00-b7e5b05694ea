# Color Palette Artwork

Color Palette Artwork is an app that allows you to upload a photograph, analyze its most common colors, and generate dynamic artwork composed of color blocks. Each block represents a dominant color present in the image, sized according to its percentage in the original photograph. You can drag the blocks to rearrange them, choose the number of colors displayed, and export the final artwork in different shapes.
